 Enhance our Remote Working
 The ability to work anywhere, at any time, is an absolute must have for any modern and progressive business, with agility, flexibility and commercial advantage, as just some of the benefits that your business can reap from an effective remote working solution. This requirement does however pose some challenges; speed and ease of access must be sustained for all team members, without compromising security and procedure.
 By leveraging Cloud technology, you can achieve far greater levels of integration between the apps, tech tools and services that you use, and with that improved connectivity, benefit from the possibilities of automating many of the manual admin processes in place today. 
 
 Drive Integration & Automation
 
 
 Replace Outdated Technology
 If you need to modernize your IT infrastructure, the Cloud is the cost-effective, technically capable solution to replace on-premise servers, transition locally-hosted applications to hosted alternatives, and securely store your various types of files, folders and databases. Instead of periodic large-scale capital investments, you can achieve flexible and accessible alternative services in the Cloud. You need a consultative partner that understands your business requirements, who will map the most appropriate Cloud servies for your needs.
 
 
 
 The Cloud solutions your business demands
 Cloud Solutions make digital collaboration and remote working simple. But like all things IT, it’s crucial that your chosen cloud solution has enhanced security protocols, disaster recovery and slick ease of accessibility.
 
 From startups to multi-divisional corporate networks, we deliver secure, cost-effective cloud solutions tailored to your needs.
 
 Cloud Migration
 
 Cloud Migration is the process of moving your organization’s entire data from legacy systems to cloud-based systems. Switching results in a significant decrease in IT infrastructure management costs by as much as 30-50%.
 
 Due to the pay-as-you-go mechanism, cloud services provide you the feasibility of maintaining and controlling your resources based on your needs. On the other hand, the legacy system prevents your business from scaling due to its limited capacity, reliability, and agility.
 
 So, when you switch to the cloud, your email, file servers, workload, applications and company records can be shifted to the cloud-based file-management mechanisms to ensure they support extensive collaboration, enhanced security and improved agility – dramatically speeding up your productivity and output!
 
 Cloud Backup
 Accidental mistakes can be costly. In 2018, 32% of businesses lost data in the cloud, causing a loss of $123 million! Fear not, we’ve got your covered.
 
 Despite what many people think, clouds do not mean you’ll never have to back up your data. According to the 3-2-1 backup rule, you should have 3 total copies of data, with 2 copies on different media, and 1 of them located offsite. This rule still applies when you choose to switch to a cloud-based system.
 
 At Infinigence Consulting, we’re deeply invested in mastering our system to ensure there is an extra layer of backup for our customers. We provide the convenience of automated backups with customizable frequencies and on-demand backups provided by a dedicated admin.
 
 From nominal backups that include Office 365 and G Suite to major on-premises server backups, Infinigence Consulting will make sure all your data is safely stored!
 
 
 Cloud File Server
 
 Globally, everyone loves Google Drive and Dropbox. While these work exceptionally well for your day to day tasks, commercial businesses tend to demand a handful of extra dedicated services, which are not provided by these leading cloud storage players.
 
 Infinigence Consulting provides a seamless and unique cloud-based storage solution that allows the users to access their data directly in the cloud, without the need for downloading or syncing. With its end-to-end encryption, data transfers are always secure.
 
 Additionally, our unique cloud service can be used for post-production workflows on-the-go – reducing the probability of quality loss and costly transfer services. With real-time collaboration and automated snapshots, your business game will never be the same!
 
 
 Centralized Signature Management
 Signature management might seem like a relatively simple task when talking about 10 to 20 users. However, it becomes a tedious chore for SMBs and large-scale organizations to set and update individual signatures for every user.
 
 Infinigence Consulting provides centralized signature management that allows businesses to adopt a consistent style of company email signature, have variations based on departments, consist of cross-platform email signature management, and satisfy the legal compliance policy of the business – all under one roof!
 
 Content Delivery Network (CDN)
 
 With the increase in digital access, the responsibility of being instant in communication with your audience has become a necessity. Infinigence Consulting actively safeguards your Internet presence by directly bringing your business into the limelight!
 
 Our customers witness a great improvement in content delivery and a dramatic surge in global audiences thanks to our intelligently-devised CDN services. They leverage the power of advanced usage analytics while avoiding the tiresome issues of high network latency. We know that slow loading times are your absolute enemy, so our CDN offers swift and reliable sharing of content.
 
 Keeping your security concerns in mind, Infinigence Consulting invests dedicated resources to maintain the security protocols while allowing the businesses to engage with their audiences and scale up their operations faster than ever. With our network spanning multiple countries, your business is bound to get all the attention it deserves!
 
 
 
 Collocation & Dedicated Servers
 Keeping your specific business needs in mind, Infinigence Consulting prides itself on providing the facilities of both collocated and dedicated servers.
 
 Our collocated servers deliver premium services while withstanding the looming cybersecurity threats, ensuring there is no interruption in data streaming due to power outages or bandwidth limitations.
 
 If your willing to have specialized and isolated access to a complete server, we’ll provide you with the facility of a dedicated server that is hosted in our data center. This allows you to avoid all sorts of security risks and probable causes of interruptions in data streaming.
 
 We are currently operational in 15 countries across the world with maximum usages tracked in different parts of Bahrain, Canada, India, Singapore, UK, and USA.
 
 
 
 Virtual Private Servers (VPS)
 
 Since Infinigence Consulting values its customers and emphasizes on the delivery of cost-efficient solutions, we provide the facility of creating virtual private servers on both shared and dedicated servers for our customers’ convenience.
 
 Contrary to popular belief, a shared server does have the probability of affecting your work due to excessive usage from other users. However, when you acquire a virtual private server, it allows you to have a more stable flow of services.

 IT Consulting & vCIO
 Proper strategic IT planning is crucial; one slight mistake and your business could come crippling down. IT Consultation services help find a cost-effective answer to IT-related fixes that are becoming pricier by the year. Not all businesses have enough resources to invest in their IT sector. In fact, Fortune 100 companies bear the costs of more than $100 billion annually caused due to multiple IT-related problems.

 Workstation & Server Upgrade
 On average, businesses are advised to replace their workstations and servers every 3-5 years. Although the upgrades can be painful due to the downtime and upgrade costs, businesses need to take preemptive measures to avoid negatively impacting their performance and security.
 
 Infinigence Consulting provides on-site surveys that allow us to accurately assess your servers, desktops, and equipment to prepare cost-efficient plans for your business. Our Technical Consultants work tirelessly to ensure that you are not overcharged and receive the upgrades required to provide smooth operations.
 
 Virtualization
 
 Most SMBs are only utilizing 40-60% of their hardware resources, which leads to excessive costs in the long run. We believe that if a business can have faster Desktop and Server Provisioning and Deployment, Small Footprint and Energy Saving, and witness improvement in Data Security and Disaster Recovery, then why shouldn’t they switch to virtualization? 94% of companies that suffer catastrophic data loss burn themselves out within two years.

Furthermore, Wireless Point-to-Point connections cost you less in the long run. In events of critical network failures, you can request a disaster recovery link as a backup to continue your operations.
 Back Up, Disaster Recovery
 Let’s be honest. It is not easy to create regular backups of all your data – especially when you are so focused on taking your business forward. According to cybersecurity experts, you are advised to back up all your vital data every 24 hours to prevent losses. Network failures are incredibly volatile and unpredictable in nature; therefore, you always need to remain prepared.
 
 Another threat is the lack of proper cybersecurity preps. In 2017, almost 61% of businesses reported an attack due to a weakness in their cybersecurity.
 
 Infinigence Consulting provides a dedicated and focused plan for your business after extensively studying its significance of data integrity and the frequency of data backups. These dedicated plans help businesses remain prepared at all times. With us, you will always have a plan B (and plan C) in place just in case a disaster strikes!

 Getting your own IT equipment may seem like an easy task, but in reality, it’s far harder. One wrong selection and suddenly, you have an overpriced system that does not work for your business. You may end up throwing in more money and time than imagined.
